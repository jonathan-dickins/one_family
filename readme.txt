Code for OneFamily Data Scientist interview task

1.	What can you find what is of interest in the data?  
2.	What are the main drivers of profit and why?
3.	Can you build a model to predict the probability of sale?
4.	Can you segment this dataset into specific customer groups? 
5.	How would you build an automated pipeline to ensure data quality as, over time, new customers request new quotations and purchase life insurance products from the insurer?

* preprocessing.R is for reading in raw data, cleaning, and some data exploration for question 1
* nbc_model.R covers question 2, modelling variables of interest against profit
* sold_model.R covers question 3, applying logistic regression and random forest models
* clustering.R covers question 4, determining k and segmenting customers into groups

data_scientist_task.ppt is the final presentation, which summarises the analysis and covers questions 5.
